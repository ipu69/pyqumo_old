    """
    Fit ACPH(2) distribution matching three first moments.

    Algorithm and moments values bounds are provided in [1]. See Table 1 for
    boundaries on M2 and M3, Figure 1 for graphical display of the boundaries
    and Table 3 for formulas to compute PH distribution parameters from
    valid M1, M2 and M3.

    If algorithm fails to fit due to values M1, M2 and M3 laying out of bounds,
    raise `BoundsError` exception when `strict = True`. Otherwise, try to
    find the closest ACPH. In the latter case, select moments with these rules:

    1. If `cv^2 := (m1^2 / m2 - 1) <= 0.5`, then `m2` and `m3` are set equal to
        `m2 = 1.5 * m1^2` and `m3 = 3 * m1^3` respectively (as for Erlang-2).
    
    2. If `0.5 < cv^2 < 1.0`, then `m2` is OK. However, if `m3` is out of 
        bounds (region BII or BIII, see Figure 2 in [1]), then `m3` is selected
        to be `m3 = 0.5 * (m3_lower + m3_upper)`, where `m3_lower` and 
        `m3_upper` are boundaries of BII and BIII, see Table 1 [1] and
        `get_acph2_m3_bounds()`.
    
    3. If `cv == 1`, then m3` is set as for exponential distribution: 
        `m3 = 6 * m1^3`
    
    4. If `cv > 1`, then `m3` is set as `10/9 * m3_min`, where `m3_min` value
        is defined as the boundary of BI (see Figure 2 in [1]).

    The same rules for selecting moments `m2` and `m3` apply if less then
    three moments were provided and `strict = False`.

    If more then three moments are provided to the algorithm, 4-th and higher
    order moments are not used in estimation. However, the alogirhtm computes
    relative errors for these moments from the fitted ACPH(2).
    
    If any moment is less or equal to zero, or if pow(CV, 2) <= 0,
    the `ValueError` exception is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    moments : sequence of floats
        First moments. If strict = True, then this sequence MUST contain at
        least three moments. If strict = False, then missing moments will be
        selected by the algorithm.
    strict : bool, optional
        Flag indicating whether raise an error if ACPH(2) can not be found
        due to moment values laying out of bounds.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        raise this when moments are less or equal to 0, or if pow(CV, 2) <= 0
    BoundsError
        raise if strict = True and moments values
    
    Returns
    -------
    ph : PhaseType
        ACPH(2) distribution
    errors : np.ndarray
        tuple containing relative errors for moments of the distribution found.
        The number of errors is equal to the number of moments passed: if 
        more then three moments were given, errors will be estimated for all
        of them. If strict = False and one or two moments were passed,
        then errors will be computed only for these one or two moments.
